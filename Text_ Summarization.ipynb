            "Enter the text you want to summarize: One notable type of generative model is the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), proposed by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues. In a GAN, there are two neural networks – a generator and a discriminator – that are trained simultaneously through adversarial training. The generator aims to create realistic data, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and generated data. The constant competition between these two networks leads to the improvement of both over time.  Generative AI has found applications in various fields, including image synthesis, text generation, style transfer, and more. It has also raised ethical considerations, particularly in terms of generating realistic-looking content, such as deepfake videos or images.\n",
